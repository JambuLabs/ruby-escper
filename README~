Usage:

Escper::Image.new('image.png').to_s 

For optimal visual results, image.png should previously be converted to an indexed, black and white 1-bit palette image. In Gimp, click on "Image -> Mode -> Indexed..." and select "Use black and white (1-bit) palette". For dithering, choose "Floyd-Steinberg (reduced color bleeding)".

To print an image directly on a thermal line printer:

File.open('/dev/usb/lp0','w') do |f| 
  f.write Escper::Image.new('image.png').to_s 
end
